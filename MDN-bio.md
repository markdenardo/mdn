MDN (they/them/we) is the livecode of M DeNardo (markdenardo);

their livecode ambient spells in M8 tracker and Hydra Video Synth
conjure visions of constellations, meditation, and infinity.

their release ‘black_hole’ addresses near-death experiences during childhood 
and the hypothesis that "all beings are singularity material."
